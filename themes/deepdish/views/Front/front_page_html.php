			<H1>Welcome to the Deep Dish Archive</H1>
			<p>Deep Dish TV aspires to build and maintain a statewide and national network of people and grassroots organizations committed to using television and the Internet as outlets for creative independent video that addresses issues and perspectives inadequately represented by corporate media. Our goal is to strengthen and increase the visibility of movements for social and economic justice in the U.S. and around the world. We do this by consciously serving communities whose images and interests are marginalized or misrepresented in the media; by encouraging the awareness and use of public access TV and alternative media for local organizing; and by promoting collaborations among artists, videographers, producers, editors and activists.</p>
