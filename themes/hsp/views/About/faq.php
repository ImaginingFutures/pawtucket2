		<a name="request"></a><b><i>What services are available from the Digital Services Department?</i></b>
		<p>Digital imaging, copies of existing digital images in the Digital Library, archival prints, and permission to reproduce, publish, exhibit, or distribute materials are available, for a fee, through HSP’s rights and reproductions service.</p>
<p>Reproductions are available as both digital files and archival prints. Our standard format for single-item digital reproductions is 300dpi 8x10 (minimum), 24-bit color, uncompressed TIFFs. Structured pricing is also available for higher-resolution digital files. Matte or glossy archival prints are produced in-house on a high-quality Epson color printer and are available in a variety of sizes from 8x10 to 24x36.</p>
<p>Please note that possession of a digital reproduction of HSP’s collection materials does not constitute permission to publish or exhibit the image. Usage rights fees may apply and vary depending on whether a reproduction is for a non-profit or commercial institution and how it will be used.</p>
