						NO BOUNDARIES: Dancing the Visions of Contemporary Black Choreographers began as an evolving repertoire of solos 
						choreographed by several generations of prominent African American artists and performed by Gesel R. Mason in one 
						evening. With choreographic works spanning from the 1940’s to the present, the No Boundaries performances delivered 
						snapshots of and created discussion around the trajectory of Black dance over seven decades.
						<br><br>
						The No Boundaries Archive Project transforms Gesel’s journey into a versatile, digital humanities platform and archival 
						database that invites you to embark on your own journey, interacting with the stories and legacies of African American choreographers.
