		<h1>Archives</h1>
		<p>As a repository and memory infrastructure for both historical and current documentation, Storm King Art Center’s Archives collects, organizes, preserves and makes accessible multi-format records of enduring value which document Storm King’s development, collections, installations, exhibitions and ongoing activities. They are made available for the administrative support of current museum activities, the successful stewardship of its collections, and for research conducted by staff and the public. In addition, a robust archival program directly reflects Storm King’s visionary curatorial and educational mission to contribute to art historical scholarship and contemporary art discourse, enhance internal and external collaboration through resource integration, and inspire an active and engaging Storm King experience for all.</p>

		<p>Among the Archive’s Special Collections, the Oral History Program offers a dynamic point of entry. Presented alongside archival materials referenced in interviews, the oral histories provide historical narratives that detail the curation and maintenance of the collection from the perspective of institutional leaders, as well as in-depth accounts from artists of creating commissioned work sited and shown at Storm King.</p>
