		<H2>Projects</H2>
		Projects are used as a way to organize your work within Bramble. You can store many different plant palettes within a project. Think of the project as your folder holding the plant palettes that are relevant within it. The project might be named something like: “Clark Residence” or “Stone Hill School Master Plan”. You can create a project in the My Projects tab, or within the Browse tab. From the Browse tab you simply select a plant or plants you would like to add to a palette. When you click the “Add selected results to palette” button. It will prompt you to create a new project to house your palette in or to add it to an existing project. 

		<H2>Palettes</H2>
		Palettes are simple a collection of plants that you want to group together within a garden or landscape. If your project is small you may only have one palette within the project. However with a larger project you may have many palettes to accommodate different aspects of the garden. Example palette names might be: “South Woodland Garden Palette”, “Dry Shade Palette”, or “Courtyard Native Palette”


		<H2>Presentation Pages</H2>
		Presentation pages are reports that illustrate or organize different aspects of your palettes.

			<li><b>Color Chart PDF</b> - The Color Chart is a graphic representation of the colors of plants in a palette. The colors represent the dominant color of the plant each month. There is also a small icon to indicate which part of the plant the color represents ie, the flower the leaves or the berries. </li>

			<li><b>Images PDF</b> - A collection of the images of the plants in your palette. Currently only the primary image of the plant shows up on the image PDF. This can be used as  design tool to see how the palette is shaping up. It can also be used to present to a client in order to illustrate what their garden will look like. We are developing the ability to sort all of the photos for a particular plant and choose which ones you would like to use on the plant image page. You will eventually be able to upload your own photos to your profile to use. You will have the option to keep the photos private to you, or share them with the Bramble Database. </li>
			<li><b>Summary PDF</b> - The summary is a report including a photo, the color chart for each plant and abridged details about the plant. The summary is for clients who are interested in learning more about the plants in their garden, or for a record of what they might expect from each of the plants.</li>

The XLSX version is available to you so you are able to add fields that don’t exist or manipulate it in any way to serve your purposes</li>
			<li><b>Order Chart</b> - This is a report that lists the plants in your palette or in a whole project. You are able to fill in the quantity of plants you need and the size at order time. This is the chart you need to give to a contractor or to a wholesale nursery to order your plants. </li>
