		<p>The UAG offers the possibility to use its permanent collections for teaching purposes. Custom-designed ArtLabs allow students to study and examine up close original works of art as part of their courses. ArtLabs can take place in the gallery or in the classroom, depending on the objects selected. </p>	
		<p>Instructors are invited to browse the collections online to make a pre-selection of objects they would like to use as part of an ArtLab. Some restrictions may apply. </p>
		<p>The Frick Fine Arts cloister and current gallery exhibitions may also be used for ArtLab sessions. </p>
		<p>Please contact the UAG to make an appointment and inquire about the program. The Gallery curator and graduate assistant will be happy to help coordinate and design an ArtLab session: <a href='mailto:uag@pitt.edu'>uag@pitt.edu</a> </p>
