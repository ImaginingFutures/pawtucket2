		<H5>About Susan Eley Fine Art</H5>
		<p>
			Susan Eley Fine Art was founded in the spring of 2006 by Susan Eisner Eley as a salon-style gallery. Situated in an Upper West Side townhouse in Manhattan, the Gallery offers an intimate viewing experience, contrary to the more formal presentations of art in typical white box galleries. Eley opened the Gallery to attract a new, untapped audience for contemporary art and to provide regular gallerygoers with a fresh, alternative way to enjoy art.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Gallery focuses on contemporary art by emerging and mid-career artists, who work in a range of media, from paint to photography to sculpture and print. Solo and group exhibitions showcase abstract and and figurative work from a diverse body of artists from the US, Asia, Latin America and Europe. Gallery artists are dynamic, active professionals, who produce strong bodies of work that constantly shift and evolve.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the exhibition program, the Gallery regularly hosts literary and poetry salons, panel discussions and our special series, â€œCollector Talks. The Gallery has participated in art fairs throughout the US, in Miami, Houston, San Francisco and New York, and abroad in Toronto. In the past few years the Gallery has developed a strong online presence marketing and selling art through platforms such as <a href="https://artsy.net/susan-eley-fine-art" target="_blank">artsy.net</a> and <a href="https://www.1stdibs.com/dealers/susan-eley-fine-art/?utm_source=susaneleyfineart.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dealer" target="_blank">1stdibs.com</a>.

		<p>
			Eley has a BA in Art History from Brown University and an MA in Visual Arts Administration from NYU.
