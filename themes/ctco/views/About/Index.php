		<p>Connecticut Collections (CTCo) is a project of the Connecticut League of History Organizations and includes a growing number of participating organizations. A customization of <a href='http://www.collectiveaccess.org' target='_blank'>Collective Access software</a>, CTCo provides organizations with a tool to help them privately manage and publicly share their collections. In turn, CTCo helps organizations build internal capacity, and by providing public access, builds awareness of Connecticut history and heritage.</p>
