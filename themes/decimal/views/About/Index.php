		<p>Fabric of Digital Life is a research archive created by members of Decimal at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Canada. This archive uses digital humanities, digital rhetorical, and popular cultural theories and methodologies to inspire this collection. Through a customized metadata scheme, it collects and catalogues the discourse surrounding the emergence of very personal technologies that promise to alter everyday life.</p>
		<p>Fabric of Digital Life Archive is inspired by a famous prediction made by Chief Scientist at Xerox Parc, Mark Weiser, in 1991: “The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it”. We are beginning to see a critical mass of early inventions working toward this end and one goal is to reflect this phenomenon.​</p>
		<p >Fabric of Digital Life is a digital humanities archive that tracks the emergence of platforms of <b>human-computer interaction (HCI)</b>, also called personal technologies, through the language of invention: inventors’ concepts, entrepreneurial adventures, science fiction films, military innovation, video games, governments ambitions, patents, news broadcasts, blogs, and advertising. This archive lets you explore the nature of emergence, the discourses that surround it, the ways we participate with it & the rhetoric that helps engender it. Use the Browse menu to explore items. Or, click on curated collections or HCI platforms to the right. Search provides full-text search access to the corpus.</p>

			<p>In Canada, fair dealing exceptions are part of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/" target="_blank">Canadian Copyright Act</a>. The Act explicitly permits exceptions for “the purpose of research, private study, education, parody or satire” (§29). Determination of the thresholds for fair dealings exceptions were clarified by the Supreme Court in CCH Canadian Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada. In this case, the Court established six principal criteria to determine fairness: 1) The purpose of the dealing; 2) The character of the dealing; 3) The amount of the dealing; 4) Alternatives to the dealing; 5) The nature of the work; 6) The effect of the dealing on the work. The Fabric of Digital Life has a tiered access system in order to limit the purposes, conditions, and amount of materials accessible, and to minimize the effect of accessing such materials.
